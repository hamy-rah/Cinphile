## How it Works

1. **Movie Recommendation**: The bot uses **OpenAI GPT-4** to generate movie suggestions based on user input. The model is designed to interpret various user moods and preferences, offering recommendations accordingly.

2. **Tracking Active Users**: The bot tracks users who have interacted with it and saves their user IDs in a JSON file. This allows the bot to provide a count of the total active users.

3. **Preventing Duplicate Suggestions**: Each user has a history of recommended movies. The bot ensures that the same movie isn't suggested twice in a single session.

4. **Conversation Memory**: The bot keeps a short-term memory of the conversation to offer better recommendations and adjust to user requests (e.g., "I've seen that movie" or "Suggest something else").
